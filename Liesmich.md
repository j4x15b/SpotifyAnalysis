This project was created as a final project as part of a training program in Data Analytics. 
The objective was to select a dataset of any kind and find interesting correlations for analysis. 
I chose two datasets related to songs on spotify: one containing the top 10,000 songs from 1950 to the present (with data from 2024) and another extensive dataset featuring nearly 100,000 songs with lyrics.
I analyzed the correlations and differences between these datasets based on the Spotify attributes, aiming to determine what makes a hit song. 
Additionally, I combined the datasets to examine the lyrics of hit songs in comparison to all songs, seeking to find what makes a hit song special.

Results:
The analysis of the Spotify features revealed that they were not very informative. 
However, it can be noted that the valence of a hit song tends to be more positive. Other attributes such as danceability, loudness, and energy are also higher in hit songs. 
On the opposite, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, and liveness are lower. 
The track duration (approximately 2:30), tempo (around 120 BPM), and loudness are nearly identical across both datasets.


Lyrics:
The sentiment analysis indicated that hit songs primarily feature positive lyrics. The theme analysis reveals that hit songs often focus on the following topics:

- Love (touch, feel, believe, tell, fall, forever)
- good feelings (life, good, think)
- body-related (body, feel, need, want, somebody)
- Dancing (dance, everybody, man, girl, hey)
