This project was created as a final project as part of a training in Data Analytics. 
We ought to pick some data of any kind and find interesting coherencies to analyse.
I chose two datasets with songs, one were the top 10 000 songs from 1950 till now played on spotify (this kind of data is always a timestamp, this dataset was from 2024) and the other was a very big dataset with nearly 100 000 songs with lyrics.
I analysed the coherencies and differences in these datasets according to the spotify metadata and tried to find out, what makes a hit-song.
Also I put the datasets together and analysed the songtexts of the hit-songs in comparison to all the songs to find out, what hit-lyrics are made of. 

Results:
The spotify-features were not very significant. 
You can say that the Valence of a hit song is more positive. Danceability, Loudness and Energy are also higher on hit songs. 
Speechiness, Acousticness, Instrumentalness and Liveness are lower. 
The Track Duration (around 2:30), Tempo (around 120) and Loudness are nearly the same in the two datasets.

Lyrics:
The sentiment-analysis shows, that the hit-songs have mostly very positive lyrics.
Theme-Analytics shows, that the hit songs are about: 
- Love (touch, feel, believe, tell, fall, forever)
- good feelings (life, good, think)
- body-related (body, feel, need, want, somebody)
- Dancing (dance, everybody, man, girl, hey)
